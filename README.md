# Rhaitous

This project serves as a proof of concept, template, or starter kit for those interested in integrating Rust applications with Rhai scripting for dynamic functionality. While initially developed as a demo, Rhaitous has the potential to evolve into a robust tool for hot-reloading configuration management, generating LLM prompts, and more.

## Description
Rhaitous integrates Rust with Rhai to offer a platform where scripts can dynamically influence Rust-based systems. It is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing users to expand its capabilities according to their needs. Currently, the project includes a directory of example scripts that demonstrate how to interact with the binary, some of which are utilized for the project's development. This setup is perfect for exploring the possibilities of scripting within a Rust environment, serving both as a learning tool and a practical solution for complex configuration management.
